# Third-party JavaScript - the code #

This repository contains companion source code to [Third-party JavaScript](http://thirdpartyjs.com), written by Ben Vinegar and Anton Kovalyov and available via [Manning Publishing](http://manning.com/vinegar).

The examples correspond to material from the book, and mostly illustrate third-party scripting concepts.

Feedback and comments are welcome.
