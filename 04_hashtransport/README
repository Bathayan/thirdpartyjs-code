This is an example implementation of the fragment identifier
technique.

To try it out yourself you will need to serve client.html and
server.html from different Origins. The easiest way to do so is
to run two simple web servers on different ports:

(terminal 1) $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9999
(terminal 2) $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9998

After that, simply go to http://localhost:9998/client.html in
your browser and press Start.
