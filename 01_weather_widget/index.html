        <h1>Weather Widget Example</h1>
        <p>
            This example from Chapter 1 renders a weather widget on the publisher's
            web page using a standard script include.
        </p>
        
        
        <!--
            Normally the script file would be served as "widget.js", but this
            requires configuring your web server to treat widget.js as a PHP
            executable.
        -->
        <script src="widget.php"></script>
